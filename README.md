# System-volume-control-using-OpenCV
This project implements a hand gesture-based volume control system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pycaw. It allows users to adjust the system volume by measuring the distance between their thumb and index finger using a webcam.

Features

Hand Tracking: Uses MediaPipe to detect and track a single hand.

Volume Control: Adjusts system volume based on the distance between the thumb and index finger.

Real-time Processing: Ensures smooth and responsive gesture control.

Visual Feedback: Displays a volume bar and percentage overlay on the webcam feed.

Requirements

Python 3.x

OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)

MediaPipe (pip install mediapipe)

Pycaw (pip install pycaw)

NumPy (pip install numpy)
